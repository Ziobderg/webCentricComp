### index.html

*Line 24*

```
<script src="index.js"></script>

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp) as shown below: 

```
src attribute "specifies the URL of an external script file"

```

- <!---How---> The code in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp) was implemented by adding the attribute to the script tag
- <!---Why---> [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp)'s Code was used because I forgot the attribute needed to use a js file
- <!---How---> [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp)'s Code was modified by changing the url to fit my file structure
